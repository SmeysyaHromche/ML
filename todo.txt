Week 1 (Sept 24-29): MNIST, Feedforward, Backpropagation, and Gradient Descent
x Learn the basics: neurons, layers, weights, and biases.
x Implement a neural network using MNIST dataset.
x Implement a feedforward neural network using Boston Housing Dataset.
x Study backpropagation and implement it in the network.
x Learn gradient descent and experiment with different learning rates.
x Track model performance: accuracy and loss over epochs.
x Study how Genetic Algorithm works, what are the alternatives. (GP, ES)
x Study Advantages and Disadvantages of GAs.
x Push code to GitHub, including comments and a README.
x Prepare to explain the network, backpropagation, and gradient descent for the weekly meeting
